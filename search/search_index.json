Multi-Repo Docs is a new process that collects docs from multiple repos and publishes all them on a single website.

In addition, suppose we have one root repo named root-docs that keeps the website related files. The idea is to trigger a job in root-docs repo to build and push the website files whenever there is a change (i.e. a merge commit) in any of doc repos (i.e. repo-docs-1, repo-docs-2, repo-docs-3). The job in root-docs adds a submodule of each doc repo to build and push the website using MkDocs static site generator.","title":"An Example of Multi-Repo Documents"},{"location":"#an-example-of-multi-repo-documents","text":"In a microservice architecture, each subsystem is in its own repository.
